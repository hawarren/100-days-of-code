# 100 Days Of Code - Log
/*
### Day N/A: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day N/A: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 73: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: In my bugtracker I worked on fixing up the third party login appearance on the login page. I also experimented with using tooltips and it's relationship to the "title=" attribute.

**Thoughts** I'm feeling closer to finishing Bugtracker. I need to brush up on my CSS, but w3schools is a great reference for the things I want to do. Also, I'm much more productive coding-wise when I am working on a deliverable (aka this is the clear predetermined outcome I want right now.)

### Day 85: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I did 3 lessons in the Introduction to Javascript lab (basicallyfrom "Intro to Functions" thru "Functions Lab"
**Thoughts** 
It felt good to refresh my memory and knowledge of syntax. It's challenging to carefully read something that I already know about, but I feel like I did a good job of actually reading everything and not skipping steps. But when it came to coding time, I coded all the tests at once because I knew what I was doing, and the only errors were typos that I quickly addressed.

### Day 87: April 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I did 3 lessons in the Introduction to Javascript lab (basically from "Functions Lab" thru "Fix the Scope lab)
**Thoughts** 
I had to read documentation to figure out the inner closure problem. Scope is tricky, but I feel like I get it. Useing ()() to call an inner item was slightly surprising, and I actually used it because I had an issue getting the other way to call an inner function to work.

### Day 93: April 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I did 3 lessons in the Data Structures lab (basically from "JavaScript Arrays" thru "Javascript Objects" lab)
**Thoughts** 
I think I understand object and how to instantiate them. I notice that I tend to gloss over the syntax, but I'm getting pretty good at solving the labs in 1 shot, which means that rather than flailing, I'm actually thinking through the problem.
This is where solving those labs builds confidence. It makes me feel "mostly right" or "right enough" when code runs and I don't fully understand why that approach works.

### Day 94: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I did up to and including javascript objects and javascript objects and arrays quiz

**Thoughts** 
Now we're getting into code that I don't understand fully. I wrote code that I believed non-destructively updated an object, but it did the opposite. I literally just changed the name so it would pass the destructive test. I see the need for me to spend more time on objects and arrays. One thing I want to do is make sure I have a solid grasp of things before I move on, without getting too bogged down into details.
