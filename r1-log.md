The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 29, Tuesday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
5/29/18
Restarted 100 days of code to honor it. I didn't want to continue with so many missed days of compliance. 
I did some work on my portfolio site. It's challenging because I'm not super well versed in bootstrap, but I managed to get a nice bulleted list looking right.
The hour ran out just as I was getting in my groove. I decided to take the moment to log my progress, save it in Github, and then tweet all about it.
It feels good, the missteps are part of the progress, and each time I end with more prettier apps.

Todo:
upload contacts app and database to my site, add to modal on my portfolio site
Add database to blog (it's already empty so it's not necessary to do anything.
Start blogging (take progress here and blog about it on my blog site)

### R1D2 
5/30/18
Fixed some links to my portfolio, also decided to add my outstanding bugs from all my projects to my bugtracker. Ran into a stupid problem where rutgers wifi was blocking my connection to my database, and it took me a while to figure out it was them (once I switched to tethering my phone it worked out).
I'm constantly amazed at the number of snafus that turn up that aren't even directly related to what I set out to do that day. It's crazy when something that worked yesterday stops working today. But it's also a test of confidence and being detail oriented, because I need to be sure that I did things right, before I can confidently say the problem isn't with me. I also found some cool resources for checking my connection string.

### R1D3 
5/31/18
Worked on contacts up, I am refactoring the multiselectlist, I ran into a problem using the directive, so I embedded it into the my application module. It still runs, so next step is to bring it into my app.
It's fun making stuff work. Instead of getting stuck, I compromised so that I could move on.
I can always refactor later 
I also realized that the previous “object reference not set to an object” error was probably from not using the => lambda function.


### R1D4 
6/1/18
Fully refactored the Angularjs dropdownmenu, and changed the variable names to more smoothly fit into my contacts app. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work when I tried to plug it in. It's strange, because I was fairly confident that I had it all together, yet I'm not sure why it's not working. I also need to learn how to use the debugger a little better. But I definitely made real progress!
