## Log

### R1D1 
5/21/18
Worked on Contacts app. I've been wrestling with the upload image functionality, finally got an image to attach client-side, but am still having trouble getting it all saved to the database.
I love the process of figuring it out, but I also need to be disciplined in my approach
I need to approach this methodically, use pseudocode, and fully attempt to implement a solution and then REVERT before moving on to another try.


### R1D2
5/22/18
More work on contacts app.
I decided to look up how to create a database, and it solved a DB problem that I had since the beginning of the project. Fixing the database allowed me to finally seed some data (at the cost of losing my previous data.
It's amazing and humbling how simple things are when I take my time to RTFM. When I rush and "flail" I waste so much more time, and a thing that could have taken 10 minutes, instead takes hours and days (!)

### R1D3
5/23/18
What I did:
Implemented user photos in my contacts app. 
Thoughts
It had alot more moving parts to figure out than I initially thought (uploading the image, displaying the image, saving the image, and linking the image to the user profile) but when it worked it was great. I'm humbled by how jerry-rigged it feels, but proud that I got it to work for most use cases.

### R1D4
5/24/18
What I did:
I started refactoring the code for a multiselect list, for my contacts app.
I need to practice making controllers and modules in Angular. I got stuck because I am not fully sure how to declare a module and it's dependencies, and how that changes syntax from when a script is declared inline.
I also struggle reading javascript, so I'm torn as to how much time to take to stop and really try to grasp the fundamentals, vs. how much time to spend just trying to get the functionality done without worrying about refactoring.
Link to work:
N/A

### R1D6
Spent most of my time getting my blog, portfolio, and bugtracker online. Still need to get bugtracker database hooked up
Also tried to update multiselectlist code to use current bootstrap and angular, it doesn't seem to fully work with the versions of bootstrap and angular that I'm using (still need to verify this)
I've already slacked on doing my 1 hour, Friday the time really got away from me and I was tired from having pulled 3 allnighters this week, trying to finish this contacts app.
I didn't know if I should count publishing my app, but I decided it counts since it's an important part of my workflow (configuring and fixing connection strings, FTP, etc.)
