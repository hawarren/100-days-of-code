### R1D1 
5/21/18
Worked on Contacts app. I've been wrestling with the upload image functionality, finally got an image to attach client-side, but am still having trouble getting it all saved to the database.
I love the process of figuring it out, but I also need to be disciplined in my approach
I need to approach this methodically, use pseudocode, and fully attempt to implement a solution and then REVERT before moving on to another try.
