### R1D1 
5/29/18
Restarted 100 days of code to honor it. I didn't want to continue with so many missed days of compliance. 
I did some work on my portfolio site. It's challenging because I'm not super well versed in bootstrap, but I managed to get a nice bulleted list looking right.
The hour ran out just as I was getting in my groove. I decided to take the moment to log my progress, save it in Github, and then tweet all about it.
It feels good, the missteps are part of the progress, and each time I end with more prettier apps.

Todo:
upload contacts app and database to my site, add to modal on my portfolio site
Add database to blog (it's already empty so it's not necessary to do anything.
Start blogging (take progress here and blog about it on my blog site)
