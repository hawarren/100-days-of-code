### R1D1 
5/21/18
Worked on Contacts app. I've been wrestling with the upload image functionality, finally got an image to attach client-side, but am still having trouble getting it all saved to the database.
I love the process of figuring it out, but I also need to be disciplined in my approach
I need to approach this methodically, use pseudocode, and fully attempt to implement a solution and then REVERT before moving on to another try.


### R1D2
5/22/18
More work on contacts app.
I decided to look up how to create a database, and it solved a DB problem that I had since the beginning of the project. Fixing the database allowed me to finally seed some data (at the cost of losing my previous data.
It's amazing and humbling how simple things are when I take my time to RTFM. When I rush and "flail" I waste so much more time, and a thing that could have taken 10 minutes, instead takes hours and days (!)
